# How to write unit tests for solidity smart contracts

### Tips for creating tests

To create effective unit tests for Solidity smart contracts, focus on comprehensive coverage, 
including both expected behaviors and edge cases, while keeping tests modular, independent, 
and security-focused. Use Test Driven Development (TDD) to guide your development, and integrate automated 
testing into your workflow for continuous validation. Monitor gas usage, verify events, 
and handle time-dependent logic properly. Additionally, employ assertive testing libraries, 
check for reverts, and utilize mock contracts to simulate interactions, 
ensuring your contract is thoroughly validated before deployment.

### Identify key test scenarios
1. Deployment Tests<br />
Check Initial Setup: Verify that the contract is deployed with the correct number of proposals, and each proposal's name is correctly stored.<br />
Chairperson Assignment: Ensure that the contract assigns the deployer as the chairperson with the voting rights.<br />
2. Voting Rights Management<br />
Grant Voting Rights: Test that only the chairperson can give voting rights to an address and that they can't grant rights to someone who already voted.<br />
Prevent Unauthorized Voting Rights: Verify that non-chairperson accounts cannot grant voting rights.<br />
3. Voting Process<br />
Successful Vote: Ensure that a voter can successfully vote for a proposal, and the vote is correctly recorded.<br />
Double Voting Prevention: Test that the contract prevents a voter from voting more than once.<br />
Voting Without Rights: Ensure that users without voting rights cannot vote.<br />
4. Delegate Voting<br />
Successful Delegation: Verify that a voter can delegate their vote to another voter, and the delegation is correctly handled.<br />
Self-Delegation Prevention: Test that the contract prevents self-delegation.<br />
Circular Delegation Prevention: Ensure that the contract detects and prevents circular delegation chains.<br />
5. Winning Proposal Determination<br />
Correct Winner: After voting, verify that the contract correctly determines the winning proposal based on the highest vote count.<br />
Multiple Proposals with Same Votes: Test the behavior when two or more proposals receive the same number of votes, ensuring consistency.<br />
6. Edge Cases<br />
Zero Proposals: Ensure that the contract handles the case where no proposals are provided during deployment.<br />
No Votes Cast: Verify the contract’s behavior if no one votes, ensuring it doesn't crash when determining a winner.<br />
All Votes Delegated: Test scenarios where all voters delegate their votes to ensure that the votes are correctly counted.<br />
7. Security Tests<br />
Reentrancy Attack Prevention: Ensure the contract is safe against reentrancy attacks during voting or delegation.<br />
Gas Limit Testing: Test the contract’s behavior under high gas usage scenarios, especially with complex delegation chains.<br />

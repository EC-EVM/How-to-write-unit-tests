# How to write unit tests for solidity smart contracts

### Tips for creating tests

To create effective unit tests for Solidity smart contracts, focus on comprehensive coverage, 
including both expected behaviors and edge cases, while keeping tests modular, independent, 
and security-focused. Use Test Driven Development (TDD) to guide your development, and integrate automated 
testing into your workflow for continuous validation. Monitor gas usage, verify events, 
and handle time-dependent logic properly. Additionally, employ assertive testing libraries, 
check for reverts, and utilize mock contracts to simulate interactions, 
ensuring your contract is thoroughly validated before deployment.
